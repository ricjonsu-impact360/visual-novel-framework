The plugin is used for script writing to show ANIM, BACKGROUND, SFX, BGM, etc list.
Plugin only works in files with extension .en.js e.g chapter1.en.js, chapter2.en.js

1. Open Sublime
2. Click Tools - Developer - New Plugin
3. Copy the content of 'script-completion.py' into the new file
4. Save as 'script-completion.py'

Alternative way (works for Windows):
1. open '%AppData%\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User' in your explorer
2. copy paste 'script-completion.py'

Optional:
- Monokai.sublime-color-scheme and script.sublime-syntax is for changing script colors in Sublime
- It can be copied to the same folder as script-completion.py but it might not work properly e.g all .js file will use the script.sublime-syntax instead of javascript syntax.
